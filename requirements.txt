# Smart Cane System - Python Dependencies for Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit
# Installation: pip3 install -r requirements.txt
#
# ============================================================================
# IMPORTANT: Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit (Debian Trixie) Setup
# ============================================================================
#
# This project is designed for Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit with Python 3.13+
# 
# BEFORE installing pip packages, install system dependencies:
#
#   sudo apt update
#   sudo apt install -y python3-opencv python3-numpy python3-pip espeak \
#                       python3-dev python3-rpi.gpio python3-picamera2 \
#                       libcamera-apps
#
# WHY: On arm64 Raspberry Pi OS, heavy packages like opencv-python and numpy
# often fail to build from source via pip due to compilation errors.
# The apt versions are precompiled, optimized, and tested for Raspberry Pi.
#
# ============================================================================

# GPIO Control for Raspberry Pi
# Note: May already be installed via apt (python3-rpi.gpio)
# If apt version exists, you can skip this, but pip version also works
RPi.GPIO>=0.7.1

# ============================================================================
# SYSTEM PACKAGES (DO NOT INSTALL VIA PIP)
# ============================================================================
# Install these using apt before running pip:
#
# opencv-python  -> USE: sudo apt install python3-opencv
# numpy          -> USE: sudo apt install python3-numpy
# picamera2      -> USE: sudo apt install python3-picamera2 (REQUIRED for Pi Camera)
#
# These packages are pre-built for arm64 and integrate with system libraries.
# Installing them via pip will likely fail or cause conflicts.
#
# NOTE: For Raspberry Pi Camera Module, picamera2 is the recommended interface.
#       It uses the modern libcamera stack (rpicam-hello, rpicam-vid, etc.)
# ============================================================================

# No additional pip packages required for this project!
# All dependencies are covered by system packages.
